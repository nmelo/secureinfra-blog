SSH key distribution across hundreds of GPU nodes. Manual MUNGE token provisioning. Rotation fire drills when something expires. Credential management doesn't scale with your GPU fleet.

Hardware-attested credentials automate the busywork. Credentials push automatically to verified infrastructure. Short-lived, so rotation happens by design. No keys sitting on servers indefinitely. Hardware trust handles verification so your team doesn't have to.

The side effect? When something goes wrong, you know exactly what credentials existed and where they could go.

## Why Doesn't Manual Credential Management Scale?

Traditional credential distribution has three fatal flaws at scale: manual processes, no automation trigger, and no visibility.

**Manual processes.** Every new node needs SSH keys distributed. Every rotation requires touching every machine. At 10 nodes, it's annoying. At 1,000 nodes, it's a full-time job. At 10,000 nodes, it doesn't work.

**No automation trigger.** How do you know a node is ready for credentials? You check manually, or you trust the provisioning system. Neither scales. Automation needs a verification signal: is this node ready to receive credentials?

**No visibility.** Credential inventories are incomplete. SSH keys get added and never removed. Service accounts get created for one-off tasks and forgotten. When you need to answer "what credentials exist on this node?", you're guessing.

Identity solutions like MFA, SSO, and certificate-based access verify the user. They don't automate credential distribution to verified infrastructure. That's still a manual process.

## How Does Hardware Attestation Enable Automation?

Hardware attestation provides the verification signal that automation needs. The DPU cryptographically proves the node is ready to receive credentials. This enables just-in-time credential distribution without manual verification.

NVIDIA BlueField DPUs implement [DICE](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures/) and [SPDM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/spdm) for cryptographic attestation. The DPU proves the node is in a known-good state, signed by hardware-protected keys.

**Automate distribution.** When a node passes attestation, credentials push automatically. No manual verification. No scripts to maintain.

**Short-lived by default.** Certificates expire. No rotation fire drill because rotation is built in. Fresh credentials get created automatically when nodes re-attest.

**Complete visibility.** Every credential distribution is logged with the attestation state at that moment. "What credentials exist on this node?" has a definitive answer.

The DPU runs independently with its own CPU, memory, and firmware. It provides the verification signal that automation needs without trusting the host to report its own state. Modern rootkits using io_uring [operate entirely outside the syscall layer](https://www.armosec.io/blog/io_uring-rootkit-bypasses-linux-security/), invisible to host-based security tools. The DPU sidesteps this problem entirely.

## What Happens When Something Goes Wrong?

**Traditional:** Incident response starts with questions. What credentials were on that system? You rotate secrets fleet-wide because you can't be certain what was exposed. Days of manual work.

**Automated:** You query the audit log. Here's every credential that reached that node, when, and the attestation state at that moment. Distribution stopped automatically when attestation failed. No rotation fire drill because credentials are short-lived anyway.

GPU clusters hold model weights worth hundreds of millions. When incidents happen, the difference between "rotate everything manually" and "query the log, credentials already expired" is the difference between a fire drill and a measured response.

*Secure Infrastructure automates credential distribution to verified GPU infrastructure. No manual key management. No rotation fire drills. See the [quickstart guide](https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/secure-infra/blob/main/docs/guides/quickstart-emulator.md) to try it.*
